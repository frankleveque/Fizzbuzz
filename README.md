Fizzbuzz
========


_"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."_

Simple enough but apparently a lot of people have trouble with this problem. It is sometimes used as an interview question to test a programmer's knowledge of loops and modulus.
